### What I learned

from this challenge i used styled-components for styling and Axios for making HTTP requests. it fetches advice from an API and displays it in a styled container. the code demonstrates the usage of useState and useEffect hooks for managing state and fetching data. it also showcases the usage of styled-components to apply CSS styles to components.
